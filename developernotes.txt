1. outputFormat:
R1_id|Gen_1|Gen_2|???
	-Question: do we write blank for read which have no alignment in reference genome??? No, we discard it!!!


2. Question: Do we need to verify Pair-End Read??? maximum allowable distance between R1 and R2 restriction??
	i. both R1 and R2 should match into same genome (either main or complement genome)
	ii. the max 2000 seq distance between R1 and R2
	iii. if there are multiple matches for R1 and R2, just verifying the above two conditions hold for R1 and R2 pair is sufficient enough to assign to reference genome

3. Assigning Read to Genome
	- assign to Gen1 if Read is matched in genome or its reverse genome with the conditions in 2 all satisfied

4. Discard reads with 'N' char in the sequence???

5. Question: For pair-end read search, what if R1 matches in reference genome and R2 don't match??? discard the match for R1??
